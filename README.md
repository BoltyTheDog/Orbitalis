# Orbitalis

Orbitalis is a physical satellite tracker and visualizer that brings orbital mechanics into the real world.  
Using a Raspberry Pi with internet access, magnetic levitation, and an OLED display, Orbitalis moves a levitating satellite model across a 3D globe.

## Hardware and Technology

- **Raspberry Pi** for control and computation  
- **Electromagnets** for satellite model levitation and movement  
- **3D globe** for geographic context (3D Printed most possibly) 
- **OLED display** for status and tracking information
- **Servos**

## Installation

Setup instructions, dependencies, and configuration steps will be documented here as development progresses.

## Future Expansion

Planned features and directions include:
- Integration with live satellite tracking APIs (e.g., NORAD/TLE data).  
- Interactive controls via OLED and knob.    
- Packaging Orbitalis as a reproducible kit or open-source hardware project.
